# RoboHash

Crates to generate robot identities from a hex hash string. Implements the RoboSats nickname generator and the [RoboHash](https://github.com/e1ven/Robohash/) profile images by [e1ven](https://github.com/e1ven) and [kyco](https://github.com/kyco/robohash).

The goal is to build a compact WASM capable of generating robot avatars in the web frontend.
